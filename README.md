4) Create a file named `.env` in the root folder of the bot, and enter `TOKEN=the_bot_token_you_just_copied`.
5) [Install node](https://nodejs.org/en/).
6) Navigate to the folder with the bots code and run `npm i`, this will install the following dependancys:
    ```
    discord.js
    discordjs/opus
    dotenv
    fs
    ms
    ```
7) You can now start the bot using `node .` in the bot's root folder.

### Updates:
This bot is currently still in development and may be buggy, if you would like to make changes simply create a pull request and I would be happy to collaborate.
